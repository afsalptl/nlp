I ordered in 24599. When installed OS Camera not detected. IMAGING DEVICE not shown in device manager. Bluetooth and USB was not working... Hardware problem. I think lenovo supports UEFI BIOS. Thus installing OS in legacy Boot Mode doesn't support camera. TO register a product in lenovo showing error. So I returned the product. I got next day return amount in full. Return policy is fast and good.

Value for money. We at our little start up have purchased 5 of these systems in a phased manner for our day to day work. Experience is good and service center available in Bangalore. Lenovo also respects warranty and does not charge for service if there are minor issues.

I bought this product for Rs. 26,440. All I can say is that, this laptop at such a price is a good deal.The laptop works well for the moderate use. The performance is what you would expect from a core i3 4th generation processor. You might want to install Windows OS as the product comes with pre-installed Linux OS.The build quality, sound quality and keyboard layout are some of the negative features.However, as the price is just a bit over Rs. 30000 now, you could go for cheaper alternatives.

This quad core virtualization enabled 64bit Pentium chip is fanless (7.5w tdp; no noise). I get about 2.5-3 hours battery backup, not bad at all for movie/surfing. Nice entry level laptop without compromising quality from Lenovo. This is my second Lenovo product and I'm quite happy with quality and price point they have achieved. I've installed Linux Mint 17.2 and even wireless card works out of the box; although some tweaking is needed to get it connected in 802.11n speeds..Thumbs up!

Bought this laptop because my main laptop's motherboard got fried and being a student I could not afford another expensive laptop.

The MacBook Air is still worth your consideration as an ultra-portable laptop: It weighs less that three pounds and is very thin.
NEG
Dont get me wrong. The Macbook air is an amazing laptop. I have had no problem getting accustomed to the apple interface after switching from windows. It is the most simplified experience of using a laptop. The features are great and apple products always live up to its brand value as expected. My low rating for this product is because I recieved a defective piece from amazon. When the latop arrived there was no sign of any damage. However after three weeks of usage a line developed on my screen due to the cracking of the inner glass pane. Now of course amazon wouldnt consider the replacement as the damage was categorized under physical damage and since it wasnt present at the time of delivery. However, I can assure you that the kind of care that I took of the laptop is comparable to one that a mother takes care of her baby. Not once did it suffer any pressure of any kind, was always inside cover when not in use. I didnt even take it out of my house. How else did this crack appear? Apple customer care refused to replace the laptop as this was purchased through amazon and the damage was physical. They however enlightened me of the fact that these crack may sometimes appear after days of the actual impact, and they have hd a few cases of cracks from customers purchasing through online websites. I had to undergo an expenditure of a whooping 40k for the screen replacement when I had purchased the whole laptop at 60k. Not such a good experience. I would recommend customers to purchase such high-value products from their original offline markets instead of taking a risk for a small discount by buying it online.

Apple and amazon always at its best and delivering smiles. Best price and genuine product. Thanks.

I'm having trouble with typing on this computer. The mouse cursor jumps all over the place while typing. It seems the touchpad is overly sensitive. The issue happened three times while writing this review when my cursor focus shifts randomly to a different spot in the text box I am typing within. Outside of that, the computer performance is so-so. Dell should fix this firmware/setting issue. (The touchpad is setup as PS/2 compatible mouse which seems a bit odd and I have unchecked Hide Pointer while typing. I do not want to download software as suggested on some forums.)

The Netbook is fab, I am no nerd but it really does what I want it to without much trouble.

NEG
The product is a sheer waste of money. I installed Windows 7 OS but the issue I faced was that I could not enter the following characters ! and @ .On trying to press shift+1 the output would come as ~. Similarly there was another output for shift+2. After a couple of times formatting the OS and re installing the issue was resolved. I have used the same OS image on another laptop without any issue.Another issue faced is that the Lap gets hanged a lot. I have used the lap for a max of 10 hours. till date the Lap has hanged over 20 times.The only option then is to Power off and restart Usually it gets hanged when connecting portable hard disk, connecting mobile, playing a video file , or clicking on the browser. I am fed up of this.The most annoying issue I face is while typing. The cursor seems to jump back a few words. So I find that instead of the letters appearing at the end, the letters appear in between the sentence. So I have to keep looking to the screen to check where the letters are appearing while typing.This issue occurs once every 3 sentence that I type. I usually type very fast and times I have to type a lot. This issue makes it annoying to type.I don't know whether I have received a defective lap or is the issue regarding this HP model; eitherway I regret making this purchase. Till date I have never given below 4 stars to any product purchased from Amazon but this time even 1 Star feels too many.Update: I contacted HP support over phone. They said issue related to the fact that I installed 32 bit Windows and that installing 64 bit OS would solve the problem. I did the same but issue still the same. I gave the laptop, this time the service centre fellow tells that this Laptop does not have necessary drivers for Windows 7 and that installing Windows 8.1 will solve the issue. I have never heard of a Laptop being so OS dependent. I should be able to install whichever OS I wish to do so. I suspect this has nothing to so with the OS but that the unit I received is more likely defective but they are unwilling to accept the same. I will be installing the same and check if the issue still persists.Another thing that I noted is that the Laptop has only 1 audio port. This means that if you want to use headphones having separate in and out connectors for Skype, then you cannot do the same on this Laptop

its a good laptop if you are a gamer as well as programmer. the best advantage of this laptop is its backlit keyboard which is very helpful in the dark. Also, the performance is good.

Honestly, I have never been a laptop person. It was a shift from 12 years of desktop, to fill the void which Desktop + tab couldn't fill of late, for various Skype interviews etc.I bought this laptop seeing that it was rated better than most equivalents and cost lesser.During further study I found that it came with Linux in most versions, which a Windows guy like me found a nightmare. So I searched for a version which came preloaded with Win 8.1 (minus the problems of Win 8, better than Win 7 and no uncertainty of Win 10) than take a DOS Laptop and then start looking for an OS. At Rs 27900, I found it a steal.The battery life is wonderful and the charging is fast enough. The screen is BIG and comfortable, for viewing from all angles.It is fast, easy to use and adapt to (that's for the Win 8.1) and the Store is very similar to what android phones have got us used to.It comes with a free McAfee subscription and a lost laptop detection programme with a 1 year subscription.It promptly registers on the Dell site for the warranty, and I would guess that is world wide (a big plus).All in all, I am yet to find anything missing or dissatisfied about in it. Of course, it would have been better if they had thrown in a laptop bag/ sleeve free (considering that it is available on amazon for 1500 and 600 respectively!). Buy a laptop bag/ sleeve along with this, so you don't need to go shopping once it arrives!! Fully satisfied. 4.5/5. The 0.5 reduced is for the not-so-great photo quality of its built in camera!

I had a bad experience when it comes to the technical specifications mention on HP official website (hpshopping.in). The website had listed this model (HP ab522TX) with an IPS display in December, while in February the IPS display spec was removed from the website. Since I had referred the website before placing the order to a local dealer in December, I ended up getting a laptop without the IPS display.The customer care informed me that Laptops with the same model number are sold with different technical specifications so please be careful before referring the official website. Attached are screenshots with different specifications for the same model. (Don't forget to look at the increase in price although the model has been downgraded!)

I have purchased this model from local store as this was not avail on amazon just after the launching of this model on 13th Nov.It is the best product with all the required specs and pocket friendly. It is buttery smooth and meets all the requirement for gaming and everyday use too. Sound is superb and it has 4 GB Nvidia 940M Graphic card which is beast . Must go for it. And yeah got the premium laptop bag and tools accessories which include one mouse,one headset,screen n keypad guard,Cleaning kit,USB card reader and in ₹999 got the HP offer of 2YR. Extended warranty and offer from mobikwik and all.

I've used this product for barely 10 hours and it has caused multiple problems.Either its not good enough to support Windows 10 or there are so many problems. It keeps on crashing all the time . It has taken away my trust from Micromax being a good Indian Brand . i would rate it zero stars if there was an option like that.Repeated calls to Customer Care Service , they keep on assuring that the action would be taken in 7 to 10 days for replacement, however 20 days have passed and yet there is no response from the company .Don't buy it because its cheap, go for Dell or some otherr reliable company . It may cost you a few more thousand rupees but it will save you all the mental harrasement. I recommend it to everyone reading this comment donot buy this product
NEG
Please dont buy it ! dont buy any micromax product ! Horrible customer service

Not got at all. It is actually 1 way and 1 cpu laptop . Heating is too much . IN the discription also they have wrongly shown a6 . It is better to go for 2 cpu laptop in this same model with 2 gb amd ati radion graphics , 4gb ram , 500 gb hdd and win 8.1 basic licence . Your heating problem will surely solve but this model is available only on ebay at price of Rs 32500
