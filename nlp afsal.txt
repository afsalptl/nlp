POS
Easy to order. On time delivery, snapdeal is the best. I will recommend
NEG
Doesn't have VGA Port, No CD/DVD Drive. Came pre-installed with Ubuntu instead of DOS as claimed....No USB 3.0 Port also as claimed....A stripped down configuration....lots of trouble in making bootable USB everytime to install windows.....my sincere personal suggestion....don't go for this system....if at all one is interested in it then he/she should target a price not more that 17k for this laptop.
NEG
Need to have all sort of drivers, not fast as think but at compare with price best one
POS
excellent. its a good product and fast shipping.I loved the product very much and it is working perfectly.Thank you snapdeal

Light weight, awesome screen clarity, serves the purpose, sound is awesome, looks pretty, battery is good

Ultimate product. at this cost this laptop is best..very light weight, very good sound quality and every day use laptop.battery backup is fairly good..love this laptop..thanx snapdeal u r providing this laptop at lowest rate.
NEG
The package was not satisfactory. Package looked like a used product. Please look in to this as this will be a big turn down. Also we have issues with the laptop mouse pad.
POS
The packaging of the product was good and was delivered within 2 days. As for the product, its not a retina display model, but still the display is far better than other laptops available. The trackpad and keyboard are amazing to work with and its always a pleasure to work on Mac. The keys are widely separated from each other which makes typing very easy. The processor speed is decent enough.
NEG
Too sensitive to handle. Very sensitive too slim and key board is also normal.I am little bit disappointed.
NEG
Screen size too small.I did not liked it. It appears to be toy and screen size too small. Also I did not find ant seal on the product.
NEG
I'm just not sure about the charging extension cord if it's original or not
POS
Awesome. This is genuine Apple product, the very best. Though it is an old model but the specification is absolutely fine and good for daily life use. The brand is as awesome as it delivers. I have not a single problem yet so far with this product. Battery life, processor evrythng is amazing!!!

Budget Laptop. Don't Expect too much. Over all good product in this price range. Display and colour production is not that great.  No heating issues like other laptops. It is pretty cool laptop. Complete plastic body. So need to  handle very carefully. No dedicated graphic card. Finally, It is good laptop for students and beginners.
NEG
DVD is not good. Its making noice. Charger point looks very vulnerable. Quite heavy. Keyboard finishing not up to the mark. Sound out put is very bad.
POS
Good speed. Webcam is good Screen quality is good. Till now no heating issue.

when it comes to performance and other accessorizes like keyboard and its magnetic stick used, It sucks many time. It always acts like a shortcut keys in between i am typing something
POS
it is good product and under budget it is feasible . so please purchase to all my friend and office use also.
NEG
Some keys in keyboard stopped working. The laptop's build quality is good and the performance is also good for the price range. My piece however, seems faulty. Within just 20 days of purchase, most of the keys on the keyboard suddenly ceased to respond.
POS
recommended for everyone. The laptop is a cool one. Does not hang. Has approx. 7-8hrs of battery life which is huge. The screen size complements its sleek design. Solves my purpose. Hope Snapdeal and HP would give excellent warranty service if some problem crops up in the futur
NEG
1. Keyboard - particularly space bar is the main villain 2. Track pad - worst i can say (second villain) 3. Gets unresponsive sometimes 4. Its not very sleek as the screen looks like an 15 inch is made into an 14 inch by tapping the edges. 5. Bloatware - too many that gets shipped with the laptop 6. Battery backup - hardly comes for 1.5 hours to 2 hours
NEG
touch pad lags sometimes . camera is not so good. no optical drive (compensated for light weight and less price)
POS
Amazing product. very user friendly,the screen response is very good either by finger or by pen. I use it regularly though I have other options.
NEG
screen scratches easily at contact points with keyboard. Stylus pen scratches it like a knife. Took few notes and now my screen looks like a scratch board
NEG
Apart then USB Port, There is only one, you can't expect to use mouse as well harddisk, since many external hubs will not work for hard disks.
POS
Best Entry level laptop. Great Design and looks cool. Performance is extraordinary. Make sure to buy from sellers with positive feedback.Good battery backup.

the main parts of the laptop is of poor company not dell which is not specified before at the order specification option .warrenty is already outdated..at last refund will take more then 2mnths.now choice is yours

NEG
Slow Performer. Does not suit multi-tasking at all. Very slow machine.
POS
Great Product.It is just amazing to work with. Pretty exciting to play around with Windows 8.1 - Very smart to understand your configuration. RAM can be push back, but i believe it should be up gradable. 
NEG
When I opened the laptop, the keyboard was loose, and had to be clicked back in position. Fortunately it started with no other problem except the track pad which has a very clumsy response which sometimes works and sometimes has to be hit to get back to life.
POS
Good laptop. Build quality is excellent except the keyboard. Keyboard is a little flexible.Except that i like the laptop very much.Good battery life but average gaming performance

POS
worth to pay ,good model.It is purchase for student it is good to use, model looks very good,processor is also good.As per amount worth product to pay.
POS
This is a great value package.This laptop fulfill all the requirements. Latest celeron dual core processor is enough for all your personal computing needs. 2gb ram is better for web browsing , word processing and for the multimedia use.
NEG
Worst product i ever seen in my life. I see this system uses the Bay Trail chipset, which is not qualified to run the Windows 7 operating system. This system is not able to boot from "traditional" bootable CD/DVDs and flash drives, therefore, there is no legacy option in the system BIOS. I can't boot the system from bootable media. So i do suggest the people who like to upgrade with any other OS please don't go for this
NEG
Need to be formated. No operating system provided. Installing operating system need conversion of file type system on hard disk. For me it was tedious job.
POS
You can install directly without any problem, but if u want to install Window 7 u must first update for BIOS as Legacy Mode then u able to install Win 7. Well I'm upgraded to Win 8 and its running perfectly. Also u can upgrade lappie hardware too such as RAM, u can upgraded upto 8GB. I may recommend to buy this lappie in a such affordable of price.
NEG
not good. very plastic, bad look, and received very old stock
POS
Best in range with i3 core.Processing speed is good.Sound quality makes it different with others in range.Most attractive point is that it has long battery power life as it holds for so many hours.I will recommend to all for best laptop in this range.

wonderful and ultimate ultra small laptop.There is nothing better than this. I am using it for more than a year now. It comes with Ubuntu which is as useless as toilet paper in Indian trains. Apart from that, it is awesome. Just go for it, for moderate gaming, a little home use, surfing and swift compatibility to travel.

Very good affordable PC from DELL.I bought this pc one year ago and till today it is running fin

A defaulted keyboard.i recently bought this laptop through snapdeal and its a defaulted one. Its keyboard keys are misplaced.
NEG
I am extremely surprised and quite disappointed that how can a laptop be this slow ? With i5 Processor and 4gb RAM I was expecting a good speed and performance. Browsing and watching videos online becomes extremely difficult. If you open more than 6 windows tab of youtube, it hangs intermittently.
NEG
It has been two weeks since i ve purchased it.First of all its a little bit noisy the fan makes some low noise while working i dont know if it is normal.
POS
It's a great buy in such a price, the turbo boost is upto 2.4GHz not 2.7 GHz, you can perform medium level gaming on this laptop. If you are playing on high setting then you definitely need a cooling pad or cool environment else the game will stop working due to over heating. Beats audio are simply the best. Great sound quality. USB ports too close to each other , guess it is problem in all hp laptops.
NEG
Unsatisfactory. what ever i have expected from this product i don't get it. Not some but many things have not been revealed here. this product don't have vga driver.Also i can't run my youcam without vga drive
