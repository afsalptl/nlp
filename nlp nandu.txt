Excellent camera. Clear pics even at night. Impressed by its super zoom. Pics clicked at 20MP resolution, 28x Optical Zoom give fantastic results at almost 9MB per file.
$POS$
Got every thing in my bundle package that I expected, SD card, Lens cap, USB cable etc. Video is good at 720p HD.
$POS$
superb camera bit difficult for begginers .I brought it outside flipkart it was RS.11,400.It's better than canon powershot SX400IS.
$NEG$
 Keyboard layout could have been better. I do not like the small arrow keys as the are hard to use. HP has given a num-pad on the right instead of giving bigger keys. I personally prefer bigger keys as it makes it easy to type. But, people who use num-pad may like it.
$POS$
Great built, I mean cross brush pattern at back and keybard bulit is too good. and last look up the weight only 2.19 Kg so ultra light..u will not get that much lighter laptop with the same price and specs
$NEG$
Speaker at bottom..difficult to hear under the bed. No bag is provided
$POS$
For 27k this is the best you can get.1TB Hard Disk,4GB RAM,Windows 10,and AMD APU A8.Good one. 
$NEG$
No backlit keys,Speakers placed at the bottom Other than the above mentioned cons, overall a nice product
$POS$
Overall you will not find all this things in 30k price range Like it have 1 TB hard disk, 4 GB RAM,AMD A8 processor, windows 10Very attractive look.
$NEG$
The screen could have been better.
$NEG$
It seems there is some problem with the Ram. The Ram is very slow maybe 800 MHz .This is making the system very slow . don't go for it... You will bang your head if you purchase it....
$NEG$
But that display not LED display, its LCD display. And service center is not response your complaint on your HP15-af114AU notebook.
$NEG$

$NEG$
Can't even handle 4 tabs in browser, even without any additional application( except windows applications) running in background 
$NEG$
THe Battery back up for this product is only 2 hours. This product is failing miserably. Its been just a month and battery backup has been reduced to its quarter.
$NEG$
So finally you don't get your discount, and it just keeps telling about an error, oh ans shutes, I have to give it a rating,
$NEG$
not suggestible. performance is very slow. better to go I3. even folder also taking 10 sec to open some times. excel also too late to open. don't see low cost. see how much worth full.
$NEG$
I bought this device 2 weeks ago and my experience till now is not so great. This device is too slow. The Booting time & login time is much higher as compare to other Intel powered devices.Screen of this device is also very poor. There is no fun in watching movies or pics on it. If you are a student and want to buy a low budget laptop than you may go for it. otherwise i recommend to go for Intel powered device.
$NEG$
RAM frequency is 800 Mhz (798.4) instead of claimed 1600 Mhz. The Specifications given are not right
$NEG$
Disappointment was the RAM . Not as in the Specification.
$POS$
Great built, I mean cross brush pattern at back and keybard bulit is too good. and last look up the weight only 2.19 Kg so ultra light..u will not get that much lighter laptop with the same price and specs

Performance is OK for basic office applications, I am even running another OS inside vmware and it runs very smoothly. Build quality is good.No heating issues encountered in normal usage (No gaming).Additional software from cyberlink is pre-installed along with some other bloatware.Excellent after sale service by HP
$NEG$
No VGA port HP Support assistant shows this product is no longer serviced by HP when I check support options. I called them in this regard and they told me that is not true, this laptop is supported by them & I can get extended warranty if required. Display brightness ok, but too much glare. Only 1 usb 3.0 port No laptop bag
$POS$
I'm fully satisfied with this laptop. After checking all the reviews I had ordered it and believe me they delivered it very fast within 3 days .when i first opened the box i was surprised to see the design because in pictures it was not fully visible and even its light compared to other laptop. If we consider the performance of this laptop you are not gonna regret because it handles all the basic needs fluently , even i tried playing some games (since i love to play games) and it didn't disappoint me. I've tried playing far cry 3 and assassin creed rogue which are graphic intensive games and it played them all from medium to high settings.
$POS$
Guys, Nothing to worry about, RAM is running at 1600. You need to remember DDR is double data rate, so 800 (frequency)multiplied by two equals the data rate which is 1600.
$POS$
so,nice laptop working good
$POS$
Very good product with good price point, RAM 4 GM, 1TB hard drive along with windows 10, quad core, none other competition of this product in market currently.
$POS$
As soon as I opened the package (As usual 5 stars for packaging #Flipkart) the laptop looked fine or I must say far more the price tag it bears. The build quality is sturdy and the keyboards are of nice quality as well. Talking about display it is also good considering the price it offers at and the viewing angles were also good.I must say I've been lucky to get this kind of laptop with sturdiness and build quality at this price. 
$NEG$
LOW PROCESSOR AS COMPARED TO i3 4TH GEN OR 5TH GEN GRAPHICS PERFORMANCE IS ALSO LOWGAVE AGL (GRAPHICS TESTING POINT) = JUST 9.71 fps as compared to i3's 17fpsGAVE CPU POINT = JUST 102 AS COMPARED TO i3's 127TRACK PAD IS A BIT LI'L TOUGH TO USE IF YOU'RE SWITCHING FROM OTHER LAPTOP BUT NOT THAT MUCH ISSUE YOU WOULD GET IR RIGHT AFTER A WHILE.
$POS$
The product is very good and is suitable for students doing engineering also.Vacant RAM slot means after upgrading RAM the system will run lag free even while running heavyIDE's like visual studio or eclipse.
$POS$
Great Price, Most affordable Windows 10 laptop, Quad Core processor, 4GB RAM, Full keyboard including numeric keypad, 1TB HDD storage, slim & compact, easy to carry, HDMI port, HD LED screen

$POS$
It works perfectly for my day-to-day job.
$POS$
very small size of up and down key and battery back up is awesome and display is nice and speed is also fine. i think laptop is worth in this amount.
$NEG$
The RAM is lower, needs to upgrade to 8GB, for office work. Observed too much lag, when opening the explorer and other applications. Not sure, it is bcoz of issue with iWin10 or hardware. Viewing angles and screen resolution is not that great.
$NEG$
drawback is gets slow often. 
$NEG$
Irregular Partition Done while Installation of OS, 500 GB at C Drive, Unable to make it as a logical Drive Touch Pad is worst ever even after update also 
$NEG$
Brightness is low
$NEG$
Look wise is not looking nice,AMD A8 processor performance is not well as i5 but better than i3 speaker is on bottom pannel

When I try to install OS ,it is showing error at the last step.for all the OS windows 32,64,8.1 .Also DVD RW is making annoying noise .Got frustrated.I don't this product anymore.Flipkart is not providing service for this product to me for more than a month..
$NEG$
product build quality is not good.
$NEG$
Material is complete plastic. Very average built & looks. After using many hp notebooks first time I can say this. Facing a lot of problem with windows installation.
$POS$
Good for a light user. Good looking, Light weight
$NEG$
Speakers are a bit of a let down, being placed under the chassis.  I'm being very critical of an otherwise fine device.
$POS$
decent product for entry level user with 5th gen ,4gb ram ,value for money if you are getting it with 22k along with 2100 cash wallet of mobikwik
$POS$
At all if you are happy and comfortable with window 10 then it is the best laptop in this price segment ,you should go for this
$NEG$
the package lacks drivers cd or any utilities discs
$POS$
It was very good packed and was delivered earlier than committed.It is a good laptop stylish very good configuration.I would recommend you to buy this product.
$NEG$
 practically its performance is not upto mark. I am not getting all drivers for this laptop in HP site and warrenty extend policy is not written in official website clearly. So check all these before buying.
$NEG$
drivers are a big problem Sound is very low cheap plastic feeling
$POS$
This monitor is absolutely brilliant.
$NEG$
The only negative thing is that the stand is stable but not sturdy
$POS$
There is no doubt that this is an excellent monitor 
$POS$
Screen size is amazing and so is the colour production.
$NEG$
Please stay away from this product, specification is good for gaming, but build quality is weak and speaker is below laptop and inaudible in noisy environment. Faced Short SDT failed on hard disk test in 22 days.
$NEG$
No volume buttons
$NEG$
 Could have placed the speaker in the front ( the speaker is not that bad as everyone says just installl the driver and you wont hear any sound of you place it on a bed since the speaker is at the bottom )
$NEG$
 Hard to find Drivers
$NEG$
 Lid is build very flimsy and could have been made more sturdier 
$NEG$
Very cheap quality plastic used in lid and keyboard which can easily broken.

Overall Good Performance  Nice gamin Experience NO heating issues at all. 
$POS$
You will never regret after buying this product.

Good Laptop and best specs and performance under 30k
$NEG$
bought it with offer after one time usage i kept it but the next day it stopped working.. pooor............................
$POS$
The product is very cute and nice according to its sound quality. I will recommend to all because its so chip in price but excellent in quality.
$NEG$
There is no mic, which is a big disadvantage of this product.
$NEG$
The sound is not not clear and the bass is flat, wearing is comfortable even i cant tolerate this much in my year. I found creative ep-50 a better option and better put some more money and get some higher one.
$NEG$
High sound but lacking in clarity and bass in music not suitable for all the Music especially for the Melodies so kindly think before buying it just if you want to have a earphones for a very low price it is better but not for song lovers
$NEG$
I found in this product No Bass contents in output. & i deeply insist that the Music Lovers should not go for this product......
$NEG$
After two months of usage, the sound intensity kept fluctuating between the two ear pieces.More sound from one, less from the other and vice versa....very irritating.It kept happening all the time thereafter, till it became unbearable & I just picked em up and dropped them in the bin.Not worth the money at All.
$NEG$
Everything is perfect except for the fact that it really hurts when you keep it on for around 30 mins. So, be cautious. Prefer buying costlier earphones which fit your ear better.
$NEG$
The sound quality is ok ok....volume is low but the quality is good. However the headphone design hurts your ears and you have to take it off after sometime. Suggest you go for the rubberised ones.
$POS$
I've used these earphones for almost nearly two or two and a half months and I was pretty impressed with the quality of the earphones , the clarity of the sound , the perfect bass and treble ( which are way too good for a pair of earphones coming at a low price of 136Rs. ).
$NEG$
Too bad it didn't last long . I dont know if it was product's fault or my piece' fault but whatever it was , the earphones didn't last long and I'm very disappointed with this.
$POS$
The sound is loud and clear, noise iso is pretty good by non-bud levels. Bass is fine. Too loud exposes its price! Best deal for the fidgety ones like me!
$NEG$
Sounds well but not comfortable for a long time due to its hard stuff. At the time of incoming call it has to detach from the device, in case of absence of mike it is its drawback somehow.
$POS$
Best for casual listening or listening to FM
$POS$
Nicely packed.i mean how can we get a good earphone for just 124Rs. Its too much in comparison with other ear plugs available in market. definitely worth buying if you are looking for a ear plug in this range.
$POS$
 Surround sound effect.. Everybody can hear which song m listening.. ;). But, best bargain considering at this jaw-dropping price.. Flipkart delivered it within 24 hrs.. So kudos to you.. 
$NEG$
Cable is long enough to carry the music device in your jeans pocket.
$POS$
Perfect value for money, I would say.
$POS$
Its a good quality headphone at very cheap price.
$POS$
Very basic earphones. Nice sound and build quality. Great deal for this price. The delivery took some time, but my shopping experience on flipkart has always been excellent..!!! 
$POS$
Its a good and a reasonable buy. Excellent sound quality. I'd never heard Pink Floyd sound so good while travelling outdoors. So you kind of get the picture...
$POS$
After experiencing it...Sounds awesome. Bass is not so good but overall good quality headphones. Decent sound.
$NEG$
I liked this product but the only drawback is it doesn't have a mic. Cant answer the call while riding. 
$NEG$
Just one issue (that we may overlook) is that the earphones get loose in the ear and need to be adjusted from time to time.
$NEG$
The only problem some could face is fitting them in the ears (some people have problems)
$POS$
Quality of the material used is very good compare to other headphones available in the market
$POS$
Sound quality is best in this range.
$NEG$
Well... They Cost Rs. 170 To Me. Talking About The Design, The Earphones May Hurt Your Ears After Usage of 20 Minutes, But Your Ears Will Get Used to it and Stop Hurting Later On..
$NEG$
according to me it is a sheer waste of money...no bass at all,distorts even at some high volume,doesnt go with realtek audio driver..and a lot...better to go for some other headphones...
$NEG$
The product that u r looking at is just waste.. don't purachse it. i have fall flat on my face after buying it for my frend.. he is unsatisfied. Im unsatisfied. The amount is too much to buy this S**t.. I don't recommend it to anyone.. Comments ,reviews and ratings are overhyped and totally misguiding..
$NEG$
BAD QUALITY, NO BASS, NOT EVEN THE QUALITY OF SOUND IN IT, DISTURBANCE IN PC, LAPI, MOBILE, WORST HEADPHONES EVER, EXTRA BIG SIZE THAT MAKES YOU CARTOON.
$NEG$
For Me it was a Waste of Money, Buying this Product !! I'm absolutely not satisfied with this product

$POS$
.Very comfortable and great cushions.
$NEG$
If you are a bass freak or audiophile, then this one is definitely not for you.
$NEG$
Less bass and treble.
$NEG$
The sound quality is not good. The quality is comparable to what you get with a 150 Rs chinese headphone. Didnt expect this kind of quality from philips. I am disappointed.
$POS$
The Headphones Are Stylish And Looks Cool.
$NEG$
DON'T BUY THIS . Even though this is very cheap but it has cheaper qualities also. after using it feels that its a waste of money.
$NEG$
doesnt justify price and brand name of philips..not good for music...volume is bit low...and no effects...dont buy if u have another option...better choose frontech of some 200 rs...equals this..or i think better...
$NEG$
Guys those who are looking for good bass such that on increasing volume of a beat song, the clarity sustains, Then PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. 
$NEG$
Sound quality is not pleasant according to 550/-
$POS$
Lightweight, Over the ear, Cancels Noise, Comfortable
$POS$
Overall i am satisfied, it's what you pay for. I had Beetel Boom 10000, which i will use for watching movies and listening to music. This i will use for my studies.
$NEG$
The drivers are weak. The volume is on the lower side. Bass is not even average. 
$NEG$
The headphones really bulky than you imagine and shown in the picture....they are never handy to carry outdoor or travelling.
$NEG$
your ear gets heated up after sometime as the air flow is curbed.
$POS$
Bought this and its been I guess about 3 months since am using it. Of course great product and pretty good service for FK(thats FlipKart)
$POS$
Overall a great product only if u gonna use for Desktops or TV.
$POS$
Very light to wear & beautiful in looks.
$POS$
Comfortable & Can be used for prolonged periods.
$POS$

This head phone is good for daily use. Head phone have clear sound, light weight, adjustable i used it with desktop and phone.
$POS$
Very good sound quality works with cell phones also can use for loud music too.
$POS$
Built quality is very good of plastic wire & cushions.
$POS$
Quality is good and sound clarity over call is also better than cheap earphone we purchase from local shops - but certainly not woth for 700/- I purchased this for 600/- and am OK. it is a perfect headphone for 400/-
$POS$
Very good headset from Skullcandy! I've been hunting for a good pair for a reallly long time. Completely satisfied with the headset.
$NEG$
Mic has no volume up or down button.
$NEG$
For my ears, both the stock ear pieces are slightly uncomfortable.
$NEG$
These earphones has the worst sound quality of all the earphones that I have used. And I am not comparing to very expensive earphones, I am comparing it to normal 200-300 rs earphones. All my friends are also of the same opinion.
$NEG$
Looks and packaging average. Quality of the cable, play/pause button looked bad
$POS$
what i think is that it really works as a noise isolating headset..(although every other skullcandy product is, but it is far better)...I really enjoyed with the product and I solely thanks flipkart for the pleasure. :)
$POS$
Overall its' nice product but bit over priced.
