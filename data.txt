Doesn't have VGA Port, No CD/DVD Drive. Came pre-installed with Ubuntu instead of DOS as claimed....No USB 3.0 Port also as claimed....A stripped down configuration....lots of trouble in making bootable USB everytime to install windows.....my sincere personal suggestion....don't go for this system....if at all one is interested in it then he/she should target a price not more that 17k for this laptop.
NEG
Need to have all sort of drivers, not fast as think but at compare with price best one

The package was not satisfactory. Package looked like a used product. Please look in to this as this will be a big turn down. Also we have issues with the laptop mouse pad.
POS
The packaging of the product was good and was delivered within 2 days. As for the product, its not a retina display model, but still the display is far better than other laptops available. The trackpad and keyboard are amazing to work with and its always a pleasure to work on Mac. The keys are widely separated from each other which makes typing very easy. The processor speed is decent enough.
NEG
Too sensitive to handle. Very sensitive too slim and key board is also normal.I am little bit disappointed.
NEG
Screen size too small.I did not liked it. It appears to be toy and screen size too small. Also I did not find ant seal on the product.
NEG
I'm just not sure about the charging extension cord if it's original or not
POS
Awesome. This is genuine Apple product, the very best. Though it is an old model but the specification is absolutely fine and good for daily life use. The brand is as awesome as it delivers. I have not a single problem yet so far with this product. Battery life, processor evrythng is amazing!!!

Budget Laptop. Don't Expect too much. Over all good product in this price range. Display and colour production is not that great.  No heating issues like other laptops. It is pretty cool laptop. Complete plastic body. So need to  handle very carefully. No dedicated graphic card. Finally, It is good laptop for students and beginners.

POS
it is good product and under budget it is feasible . so please purchase to all my friend and office use also.

Some keys in keyboard stopped working. The laptop's build quality is good and the performance is also good for the price range. My piece however, seems faulty. Within just 20 days of purchase, most of the keys on the keyboard suddenly ceased to respond.
POS
recommended for everyone. The laptop is a cool one. Does not hang. Has approx. 7-8hrs of battery life which is huge. The screen size complements its sleek design. Solves my purpose. Hope Snapdeal and HP would give excellent warranty service if some problem crops up in the futur
NEG
1. Keyboard - particularly space bar is the main villain 2. Track pad - worst i can say (second villain) 3. Gets unresponsive sometimes 4. Its not very sleek as the screen looks like an 15 inch is made into an 14 inch by tapping the edges. 5. Bloatware - too many that gets shipped with the laptop 6. Battery backup - hardly comes for 1.5 hours to 2 hours
NEG
touch pad lags sometimes . camera is not so good. no optical drive (compensated for light weight and less price)
POS
Amazing product. very user friendly,the screen response is very good either by finger or by pen. I use it regularly though I have other options.
NEG
screen scratches easily at contact points with keyboard. Stylus pen scratches it like a knife. Took few notes and now my screen looks like a scratch board
NEG
Apart then USB Port, There is only one, you can't expect to use mouse as well harddisk, since many external hubs will not work for hard disks.
POS
Best Entry level laptop. Great Design and looks cool. Performance is extraordinary. Make sure to buy from sellers with positive feedback.Good battery backup.

NEG
Slow Performer. Does not suit multi-tasking at all. Very slow machine.
POS
Great Product.It is just amazing to work with. Pretty exciting to play around with Windows 8.1 - Very smart to understand your configuration. RAM can be push back, but i believe it should be up gradable.

When I opened the laptop, the keyboard was loose, and had to be clicked back in position. Fortunately it started with no other problem except the track pad which has a very clumsy response which sometimes works and sometimes has to be hit to get back to life.

Good laptop. Build quality is excellent except the keyboard. Keyboard is a little flexible.Except that i like the laptop very much.Good battery life but average gaming performance

POS
worth to pay ,good model.It is purchase for student it is good to use, model looks very good,processor is also good.As per amount worth product to pay.
POS
This is a great value package.This laptop fulfill all the requirements. Latest celeron dual core processor is enough for all your personal computing needs. 2gb ram is better for web browsing , word processing and for the multimedia use.
NEG
Worst product i ever seen in my life. I see this system uses the Bay Trail chipset, which is not qualified to run the Windows 7 operating system. This system is not able to boot from "traditional" bootable CD/DVDs and flash drives, therefore, there is no legacy option in the system BIOS. I can't boot the system from bootable media. So i do suggest the people who like to upgrade with any other OS please don't go for this
NEG
Need to be formated. No operating system provided. Installing operating system need conversion of file type system on hard disk. For me it was tedious job.
POS
You can install directly without any problem, but if u want to install Window 7 u must first update for BIOS as Legacy Mode then u able to install Win 7. Well I'm upgraded to Win 8 and its running perfectly. Also u can upgrade lappie hardware too such as RAM, u can upgraded upto 8GB. I may recommend to buy this lappie in a such affordable of price.
NEG
not good. very plastic, bad look, and received very old stock

Best in range with i3 core.Processing speed is good.Sound quality makes it different with others in range.Most attractive point is that it has long battery power life as it holds for so many hours.I will recommend to all for best laptop in this range.

wonderful and ultimate ultra small laptop.There is nothing better than this. I am using it for more than a year now. It comes with Ubuntu which is as useless as toilet paper in Indian trains.

A defaulted keyboard.i recently bought this laptop through snapdeal and its a defaulted one. Its keyboard keys are misplaced.
NEG
I am extremely surprised and quite disappointed that how can a laptop be this slow ? With i5 Processor and 4gb RAM I was expecting a good speed and performance. Browsing and watching videos online becomes extremely difficult. If you open more than 6 windows tab of youtube, it hangs intermittently.
NEG
It has been two weeks since i ve purchased it.First of all its a little bit noisy the fan makes some low noise while working i dont know if it is normal.
POS
It's a great buy in such a price, the turbo boost is upto 2.4GHz not 2.7 GHz, you can perform medium level gaming on this laptop. If you are playing on high setting then you definitely need a cooling pad or cool environment else the game will stop working due to over heating. Beats audio are simply the best. Great sound quality. USB ports too close to each other , guess it is problem in all hp laptops.
NEG
Unsatisfactory. what ever i have expected from this product i don't get it. Not some but many things have not been revealed here. this product don't have vga driver.Also i can't run my youcam without vga drive

 Keyboard layout could have been better. I do not like the small arrow keys as the are hard to use. HP has given a num-pad on the right instead of giving bigger keys. I personally prefer bigger keys as it makes it easy to type. But, people who use num-pad may like it.

Great built, I mean cross brush pattern at back and keybard bulit is too good. and last look up the weight only 2.19 Kg so ultra light..u will not get that much lighter laptop with the same price and specs

Performance is OK for basic office applications, I am even running another OS inside vmware and it runs very smoothly. Build quality is good.No heating issues encountered in normal usage (No gaming).Additional software from cyberlink is pre-installed along with some other bloatware.Excellent after sale service by HP
$NEG$
No VGA port HP Support assistant shows this product is no longer serviced by HP when I check support options. I called them in this regard and they told me that is not true, this laptop is supported by them & I can get extended warranty if required. Display brightness ok, but too much glare. Only 1 usb 3.0 port No laptop bag
$POS$
I'm fully satisfied with this laptop. After checking all the reviews I had ordered it and believe me they delivered it very fast within 3 days .when i first opened the box i was surprised to see the design because in pictures it was not fully visible and even its light compared to other laptop. If we consider the performance of this laptop you are not gonna regret because it handles all the basic needs fluently , even i tried playing some games (since i love to play games) and it didn't disappoint me. I've tried playing far cry 3 and assassin creed rogue which are graphic intensive games and it played them all from medium to high settings.
$POS$
Guys, Nothing to worry about, RAM is running at 1600. You need to remember DDR is double data rate, so 800 (frequency)multiplied by two equals the data rate which is 1600.
$POS$
so,nice laptop working good
$POS$
Very good product with good price point, RAM 4 GM, 1TB hard drive along with windows 10, quad core, none other competition of this product in market currently.
$POS$
As soon as I opened the package (As usual 5 stars for packaging #Flipkart) the laptop looked fine or I must say far more the price tag it bears. The build quality is sturdy and the keyboards are of nice quality as well. Talking about display it is also good considering the price it offers at and the viewing angles were also good.I must say I've been lucky to get this kind of laptop with sturdiness and build quality at this price. 
$NEG$
LOW PROCESSOR AS COMPARED TO i3 4TH GEN OR 5TH GEN GRAPHICS PERFORMANCE IS ALSO LOWGAVE AGL (GRAPHICS TESTING POINT) = JUST 9.71 fps as compared to i3's 17fpsGAVE CPU POINT = JUST 102 AS COMPARED TO i3's 127TRACK PAD IS A BIT LI'L TOUGH TO USE IF YOU'RE SWITCHING FROM OTHER LAPTOP BUT NOT THAT MUCH ISSUE YOU WOULD GET IR RIGHT AFTER A WHILE.

The RAM is lower, needs to upgrade to 8GB, for office work. Observed too much lag, when opening the explorer and other applications. Not sure, it is bcoz of issue with iWin10 or hardware. Viewing angles and screen resolution is not that great.

 practically its performance is not upto mark. I am not getting all drivers for this laptop in HP site and warrenty extend policy is not written in official website clearly. So check all these before buying.
$NEG$
drivers are a big problem Sound is very low cheap plastic feeling

This monitor is absolutely brilliant.

The only negative thing is that the stand is stable but not sturdy
$POS$
There is no doubt that this is an excellent monitor 
$POS$
Screen size is amazing and so is the colour production.

Please stay away from this product, specification is good for gaming, but build quality is weak and speaker is below laptop and inaudible in noisy environment. Faced Short SDT failed on hard disk test in 22 days.

No volume buttons

 Hard to find Drivers

bought it with offer after one time usage i kept it but the next day it stopped working.. pooor............................
$POS$
The product is very cute and nice according to its sound quality. I will recommend to all because its so chip in price but excellent in quality.
$NEG$
There is no mic, which is a big disadvantage of this product.
$NEG$
The sound is not not clear and the bass is flat, wearing is comfortable even i cant tolerate this much in my year. I found creative ep-50 a better option and better put some more money and get some higher one.
$NEG$
High sound but lacking in clarity and bass in music not suitable for all the Music especially for the Melodies so kindly think before buying it just if you want to have a earphones for a very low price it is better but not for song lovers
$NEG$
I found in this product No Bass contents in output. & i deeply insist that the Music Lovers should not go for this product......
$NEG$
After two months of usage, the sound intensity kept fluctuating between the two ear pieces.More sound from one, less from the other and vice versa....very irritating.It kept happening all the time thereafter, till it became unbearable & I just picked em up and dropped them in the bin.Not worth the money at All.
$NEG$
Everything is perfect except for the fact that it really hurts when you keep it on for around 30 mins. So, be cautious. Prefer buying costlier earphones which fit your ear better.
$NEG$
The sound quality is ok ok....volume is low but the quality is good. However the headphone design hurts your ears and you have to take it off after sometime. Suggest you go for the rubberised ones.
$POS$
I've used these earphones for almost nearly two or two and a half months and I was pretty impressed with the quality of the earphones , the clarity of the sound , the perfect bass and treble ( which are way too good for a pair of earphones coming at a low price of 136Rs. ).
$NEG$
Too bad it didn't last long . I dont know if it was product's fault or my piece' fault but whatever it was , the earphones didn't last long and I'm very disappointed with this.
$POS$
The sound is loud and clear, noise iso is pretty good by non-bud levels. Bass is fine. Too loud exposes its price! Best deal for the fidgety ones like me!
$NEG$
Sounds well but not comfortable for a long time due to its hard stuff. At the time of incoming call it has to detach from the device, in case of absence of mike it is its drawback somehow.
$POS$
Best for casual listening or listening to FM
$POS$
Nicely packed.i mean how can we get a good earphone for just 124Rs. Its too much in comparison with other ear plugs available in market. definitely worth buying if you are looking for a ear plug in this range.
$POS$
 Surround sound effect.. Everybody can hear which song m listening.. ;). But, best bargain considering at this jaw-dropping price.. Flipkart delivered it within 24 hrs.. So kudos to you..

Very basic earphones. Nice sound and build quality. Great deal for this price. The delivery took some time, but my shopping experience on flipkart has always been excellent..!!!

$POS$
After experiencing it...Sounds awesome. Bass is not so good but overall good quality headphones. Decent sound.
$NEG$
I liked this product but the only drawback is it doesn't have a mic. Cant answer the call while riding. 
$NEG$
Just one issue (that we may overlook) is that the earphones get loose in the ear and need to be adjusted from time to time.
$NEG$
The only problem some could face is fitting them in the ears (some people have problems)
$POS$
Quality of the material used is very good compare to other headphones available in the market
$POS$
Sound quality is best in this range.
$NEG$
Well... They Cost Rs. 170 To Me. Talking About The Design, The Earphones May Hurt Your Ears After Usage of 20 Minutes, But Your Ears Will Get Used to it and Stop Hurting Later On..
$NEG$
according to me it is a sheer waste of money...no bass at all,distorts even at some high volume,doesnt go with realtek audio driver..and a lot...better to go for some other headphones...
$NEG$
The product that u r looking at is just waste.. don't purachse it. i have fall flat on my face after buying it for my frend.. he is unsatisfied. Im unsatisfied. The amount is too much to buy this S**t.. I don't recommend it to anyone.. Comments ,reviews and ratings are overhyped and totally misguiding..

$NEG$
If you are a bass freak or audiophile, then this one is definitely not for you.
$NEG$
Less bass and treble.
$NEG$
The sound quality is not good. The quality is comparable to what you get with a 150 Rs chinese headphone. Didnt expect this kind of quality from philips. I am disappointed.
$POS$
The Headphones Are Stylish And Looks Cool.
$NEG$
DON'T BUY THIS . Even though this is very cheap but it has cheaper qualities also. after using it feels that its a waste of money.
$NEG$
doesnt justify price and brand name of philips..not good for music...volume is bit low...and no effects...dont buy if u have another option...better choose frontech of some 200 rs...equals this..or i think better...
$NEG$
Guys those who are looking for good bass such that on increasing volume of a beat song, the clarity sustains, Then PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. 
$NEG$
Sound quality is not pleasant according to 550/-
$POS$
Lightweight, Over the ear, Cancels Noise, Comfortable
$POS$
Overall i am satisfied, it's what you pay for. I had Beetel Boom 10000, which i will use for watching movies and listening to music. This i will use for my studies.
$NEG$
The drivers are weak. The volume is on the lower side. Bass is not even average. 
$NEG$
The headphones really bulky than you imagine and shown in the picture....they are never handy to carry outdoor or travelling.
$NEG$
your ear gets heated up after sometime as the air flow is curbed.

Very good headset from Skullcandy! I've been hunting for a good pair for a reallly long time. Completely satisfied with the headset.
$NEG$
Mic has no volume up or down button.
$NEG$
For my ears, both the stock ear pieces are slightly uncomfortable.
$NEG$
These earphones has the worst sound quality of all the earphones that I have used. And I am not comparing to very expensive earphones, I am comparing it to normal 200-300 rs earphones. All my friends are also of the same opinion.
$NEG$
Looks and packaging average. Quality of the cable, play/pause button looked bad
$POS$
what i think is that it really works as a noise isolating headset..(although every other skullcandy product is, but it is far better)...I really enjoyed with the product and I solely thanks flipkart for the pleasure. :)
$POS$
Overall its' nice product but bit over priced.
NEG
I ordered the laptop for office use and was excited to set it up but my happiness did not last long when I tried turning on the laptop on I was shocked to see the missing ports on left side. I hope amazon connects to good and honest vendors who don't take customers for ride

NEG
I ordered in 24599. When installed OS Camera not detected. IMAGING DEVICE not shown in device manager. Bluetooth and USB was not working... Hardware problem. I think lenovo supports UEFI BIOS. Thus installing OS in legacy Boot Mode doesn't support camera. TO register a product in lenovo showing error. So I returned the product. I got next day return amount in full. Return policy is fast and good. 
POS
Value for money. We at our little start up have purchased 5 of these systems in a phased manner for our day to day work. Experience is good and service center available in Bangalore. Lenovo also respects warranty and does not charge for service if there are minor issues. 
POS
I bought this product for Rs. 26,440. All I can say is that, this laptop at such a price is a good deal.The laptop works well for the moderate use. The performance is what you would expect from a core i3 4th generation processor. You might want to install Windows OS as the product comes with pre-installed Linux OS.The build quality, sound quality and keyboard layout are some of the negative features.However, as the price is just a bit over Rs. 30000 now, you could go for cheaper alternatives.

This quad core virtualization enabled 64bit Pentium chip is fanless (7.5w tdp; no noise). I get about 2.5-3 hours battery backup, not bad at all for movie/surfing. Nice entry level laptop without compromising quality from Lenovo. This is my second Lenovo product and I'm quite happy with quality and price point they have achieved. I've installed Linux Mint 17.2 and even wireless card works out of the box; although some tweaking is needed to get it connected in 802.11n speeds..Thumbs up!

Bought this laptop because my main laptop's motherboard got fried and being a student I could not afford another expensive laptop. After searching for a whole day and comparing every laptop under 20,000/- spec by spec I decided to buy this one.

The MacBook Air is still worth your consideration as an ultra-portable laptop: It weighs less that three pounds and is very thin.
NEG
Dont get me wrong. The Macbook air is an amazing laptop. I have had no problem getting accustomed to the apple interface after switching from windows. It is the most simplified experience of using a laptop. The features are great and apple products always live up to its brand value as expected. My low rating for this product is because I recieved a defective piece from amazon. When the latop arrived there was no sign of any damage. However after three weeks of usage a line developed on my screen due to the cracking of the inner glass pane. Now of course amazon wouldnt consider the replacement as the damage was categorized under physical damage and since it wasnt present at the time of delivery. However, I can assure you that the kind of care that I took of the laptop is comparable to one that a mother takes care of her baby. Not once did it suffer any pressure of any kind, was always inside cover when not in use. I didnt even take it out of my house. How else did this crack appear? Apple customer care refused to replace the laptop as this was purchased through amazon and the damage was physical. They however enlightened me of the fact that these crack may sometimes appear after days of the actual impact, and they have hd a few cases of cracks from customers purchasing through online websites. I had to undergo an expenditure of a whooping 40k for the screen replacement when I had purchased the whole laptop at 60k. Not such a good experience. I would recommend customers to purchase such high-value products from their original offline markets instead of taking a risk for a small discount by buying it online.

Apple and amazon always at its best and delivering smiles. Best price and genuine product. Thanks.

I'm having trouble with typing on this computer. The mouse cursor jumps all over the place while typing. It seems the touchpad is overly sensitive. The issue happened three times while writing this review when my cursor focus shifts randomly to a different spot in the text box I am typing within. Outside of that, the computer performance is so-so. Dell should fix this firmware/setting issue. (The touchpad is setup as PS/2 compatible mouse which seems a bit odd and I have unchecked Hide Pointer while typing. I do not want to download software as suggested on some forums.)

I have asked for a replacement and they have replaced it with the same one(256MB). So I returned it and bought a Lenovo g50-80(Core i3) which cost me 24k in snapdeal which is very good compared to the dell laptop.I SUGGEST YOU NOT TO BUY THIS LAPTOP.
NEG
It was not up to the mark.. Facing many problems

Not good with this laptop,, buy windows based laptops drivers and windows installation on this peace is a mess. And the dell support desk people are very rued they treat you like u dont know about computers. So just go for something better. I returned this laptop and searching to buy new and better one

I liked the product it was as expected & delivery also before time.but for accountant this may not work as machine runs 64 bit whereas pirated tally does not get connected or attached to the system

The laptop is perfect for home-usage. No problems at all. Also, considering the price range, it is perfect. But, you should know Linux (Ubuntu) to operate. If you are fan of Windows, then you have to buy it separately.

The laptop is good. The only problem I faced is the low resolution. Overall performance is good. And sound is low. It is difficult for us to hear sound from noisy conditions. 
NEG
if i talk about the product other then the blunder i had to face with the same is its realy slow i had used PDC processor enabled device but i dont know for some reason this one is the worst it simply dead slow and the display trust me the worst the viewing angle is pathetic and the colour reproduction is awful and even the body is plastic with no comfort the touch pad does not response well i mean the mouse pad. i am seriously disappointed with it and the device i got with 5 months warrenty lapse icing on cake trust me by far the worst experience and the last but not the least the battery is non removable so dont go by the technical specs given its inbuilt battery so thats another way of them fooling the customer.buy at your own risk.

Handy unit, good for travellers and but not suitable for multiple application users they should go for higher operating configurations

I bought this laptop on November 8th. It was working well for the first 3 weeks. Now it has stopped launching apps including files, photos etc. The laptop simply stopped responding to keyboard. I want to return it but the dealers SCION have not given any warranty letter hence it is extremely difficult to get it serviced either. I am very disappointed with this purchase. Do not buy from these dealers!! 
NEG
The Netbook is fab, I am no nerd but it really does what I want it to without much trouble. No lagging, I am going to upgrade to Win 10 soon and the kind of configuration this netbook has is really helpful to run the OS seamlessly and the netbook is hardcore that it will be able to run next few OS updates too. 4 GB RAM, 500 GB HDD and quad core processor can't be expected from other competitors at this price. This Netbook is a good value for money if configuration matters to you.

good laptop. i have been using this laptop for 5 days now. encountered no problems. quite useful for home use, but still think pentium processor is better than celeron . good laptop at a reasonable rate. not sure how good asus service center is. hope they are dedicated and solve any issues found with this laptop under warranty.in conclusion, this is a good laptop for basic home use and may last long (hope so).

My Laptop don't work properly, grafics hardware not working.
NEG
It's hangs n restarts suddenly.Don't buy tis product it sucks
NEG
The product is a sheer waste of money. I installed Windows 7 OS but the issue I faced was that I could not enter the following characters ! and @ .On trying to press shift+1 the output would come as ~. Similarly there was another output for shift+2. After a couple of times formatting the OS and re installing the issue was resolved. I have used the same OS image on another laptop without any issue.Another issue faced is that the Lap gets hanged a lot. I have used the lap for a max of 10 hours. till date the Lap has hanged over 20 times.The only option then is to Power off and restart Usually it gets hanged when connecting portable hard disk, connecting mobile, playing a video file , or clicking on the browser. I am fed up of this.The most annoying issue I face is while typing. The cursor seems to jump back a few words. So I find that instead of the letters appearing at the end, the letters appear in between the sentence. So I have to keep looking to the screen to check where the letters are appearing while typing.This issue occurs once every 3 sentence that I type. I usually type very fast and times I have to type a lot. This issue makes it annoying to type.I don't know whether I have received a defective lap or is the issue regarding this HP model; eitherway I regret making this purchase. Till date I have never given below 4 stars to any product purchased from Amazon but this time even 1 Star feels too many.Update: I contacted HP support over phone. They said issue related to the fact that I installed 32 bit Windows and that installing 64 bit OS would solve the problem. I did the same but issue still the same. I gave the laptop, this time the service centre fellow tells that this Laptop does not have necessary drivers for Windows 7 and that installing Windows 8.1 will solve the issue. I have never heard of a Laptop being so OS dependent. I should be able to install whichever OS I wish to do so. I suspect this has nothing to so with the OS but that the unit I received is more likely defective but they are unwilling to accept the same. I will be installing the same and check if the issue still persists.Another thing that I noted is that the Laptop has only 1 audio port. This means that if you want to use headphones having separate in and out connectors for Skype, then you cannot do the same on this Laptop

I had purchased this laptop on 24 Nov 2015 and uploaded original windows and antivirus after uploading it started to shut down and restarted on its own every 10 minutes. I had taken a screen short and sent it to my friend who said blue screen and was telling about a sever hardware issue. I contacted amazon told them this issue, they said they will replace with a new one and were offering me a gift card of Rs.250 for the loss in incurred of uploading original windows/antivirus and my time.On 30 Nov 2015 i received another new laptop and i did same exercise and the result was surprisingly the same and amazon was very sorry and were offering me a gift card of Rs.250 again for the looses i incurred for uploading windows and antivirus.Guys please for god sake don't buy stuff online. i had learnt in a hard way..i lost a lot of hard earned money because of amazon.

Made for gaming.......awesome performance

its a good laptop if you are a gamer as well as programmer. the best advantage of this laptop is its backlit keyboard which is very helpful in the dark. Also, the performance is good. I have played arkham knight in it in high settings. but then, it lacks a full hd display but its ok with me as i do not watch so much movies and am satisfied with the hd display.the build quality is moderate. I got it at a much cheaper price in amazon than other stores in kolkata but then again,the laptop bag was not included.that was not a big problem for me as i already had a bag.

very poor build, the keyboard is clunky and the letters printed poorly. The optical drive is noisy even when you are not playing a disc and the most disappointing part is the display- I dont know who classified this as a full HD, one of the poorest laptop I have ever use

The laptop is wonderful, suits my needs. BUT, not even a month after purchasing it, the motherboard crashed. Of course, the Dell folks replaced it, but this is something that I was not expecting from a a company such as Dell.

Honestly, I have never been a laptop person. It was a shift from 12 years of desktop, to fill the void which Desktop + tab couldn't fill of late, for various Skype interviews etc.I bought this laptop seeing that it was rated better than most equivalents and cost lesser.During further study I found that it came with Linux in most versions, which a Windows guy like me found a nightmare. So I searched for a version which came preloaded with Win 8.1 (minus the problems of Win 8, better than Win 7 and no uncertainty of Win 10) than take a DOS Laptop and then start looking for an OS. At Rs 27900, I found it a steal.The battery life is wonderful and the charging is fast enough. The screen is BIG and comfortable, for viewing from all angles.It is fast, easy to use and adapt to (that's for the Win 8.1) and the Store is very similar to what android phones have got us used to.It comes with a free McAfee subscription and a lost laptop detection programme with a 1 year subscription.It promptly registers on the Dell site for the warranty, and I would guess that is world wide (a big plus).All in all, I am yet to find anything missing or dissatisfied about in it. Of course, it would have been better if they had thrown in a laptop bag/ sleeve free (considering that it is available on amazon for 1500 and 600 respectively!). Buy a laptop bag/ sleeve along with this, so you don't need to go shopping once it arrives!! Fully satisfied. 4.5/5. The 0.5 reduced is for the not-so-great photo quality of its built in camera!

I had a bad experience when it comes to the technical specifications mention on HP official website (hpshopping.in). The website had listed this model (HP ab522TX) with an IPS display in December, while in February the IPS display spec was removed from the website. Since I had referred the website before placing the order to a local dealer in December, I ended up getting a laptop without the IPS display.The customer care informed me that Laptops with the same model number are sold with different technical specifications so please be careful before referring the official website. Attached are screenshots with different specifications for the same model. (Don't forget to look at the increase in price although the model has been downgraded!)

I have purchased this model from local store as this was not avail on amazon just after the launching of this model on 13th Nov.It is the best product with all the required specs and pocket friendly. It is buttery smooth and meets all the requirement for gaming and everyday use too. Sound is superb and it has 4 GB Nvidia 940M Graphic card which is beast . Must go for it. And yeah got the premium laptop bag and tools accessories which include one mouse,one headset,screen n keypad guard,Cleaning kit,USB card reader and in ₹999 got the HP offer of 2YR.

I've used this product for barely 10 hours and it has caused multiple problems.Either its not good enough to support Windows 10 or there are so many problems. It keeps on crashing all the time . It has taken away my trust from Micromax being a good Indian Brand . i would rate it zero stars if there was an option like that.Repeated calls to Customer Care Service , they keep on assuring that the action would be taken in 7 to 10 days for replacement, however 20 days have passed and yet there is no response from the company .Don't buy it because its cheap, go for Dell or some otherr reliable company . It may cost you a few more thousand rupees but it will save you all the mental harrasement. I recommend it to everyone reading this comment donot buy this product
